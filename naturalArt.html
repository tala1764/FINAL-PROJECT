              as if they were in their dreamland, a book can never be trusted by it's cover. 
              In reality, the pretty rabbit is the bitter death, carrying him to his demise in the
              prettiest image ever! He may not be aware of her true face, but he knows when he can
              get to that promised land, after giving up on everything and embracing death~
