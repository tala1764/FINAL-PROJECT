            <p class="t">-This anime is about 6 vampire half-brothers who are offered sacrificial brides. 
              Their most recent sacrifcial bride was Yui Komoro, who was distressed and had her blood
              drunk by them. We see her journey as she attempts to discover about their pasts, and
              why she had an exceptionally "delicious" blood, as the brothers claimed, making them 
              addicted to her blood even more and involve in many fights with each other for her blood.

              happens to have become the title of the painting, "WHO AM I?"! Her shirt was crimson
              red and black, it had Mickey Mouse's head on it. For such, the colors of the room in
              the painting represent the shirt. Despite how deep the painting looks, it has no
              certain meaning or refereance to a certain theme, it is simply mysterious, this is 
              becuase the shirt MISHO had had no certain emotion of happiness or saddness..It was 
              and still is a mystery that shall never be resolved.

                      <h5 class="rubik-bubbles-regular mio">-She is a Syrian artist who found her passion towards
                        architecture and is currently a 2nd year college student! As her hobby, she has 
                        always been passionate about art and has been drawing since age 6. Throughout the
                        years, her art skills have frequently developed to th point that no painting has the same quality as the other. Of course, MIOSH is only a nickname to maintain her identity anonymous for 
                        protection purposes.
