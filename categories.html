            <p class="t">-This anime is about 6 vampire half-brothers who are offered sacrificial brides. 
              Their most recent sacrifcial bride was Yui Komoro, who was distressed and had her blood
              drunk by them. We see her journey as she attempts to discover about their pasts, and
              why she had an exceptionally "delicious" blood, as the brothers claimed, making them 
              addicted to her blood even more and involve in many fights with each other for her blood.

            <p class="t4">-This may not be a part of a show, but MISHO was very inspired by her shirt that 
              happens to have become the title of the painting, "WHO AM I?"! Her shirt was crimson
              red and black, it had Mickey Mouse's head on it. For such, the colors of the room in
              the painting represent the shirt. Despite how deep the painting looks, it has no
              certain meaning or refereance to a certain theme, it is simply mysterious, this is 
              becuase the shirt MISHO had had no certain emotion of happiness or saddness..It was 
              and still is a mystery that shall never be resolved.
